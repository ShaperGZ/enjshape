TODO:
* test more with windows
* add more robust data verification (check for bad polygons). A bad polygon can cause every polygon before it not to render
* create advanced options for loading in shape files (rendering a range of shapes, flatten vs. world coordinates)
* add support for more shapetypes
* figure out why sketchup skips rendering some faces when rendering a large number
* improve webdialog UI (loadShape.html)


FIXES + FEATURES:
0.1 -> 0.2
* Too many to mention
* properly treats shapefile units (importing with feet doesn't blow up)
* checks for duplicate points in polygons
* refactored code
